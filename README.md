# NHL PBP Data Scraper

## Version: 1.0.1

## Developer: Zach Andrews (StatsByZach)

### Overview

This Python program is designed to scrape and clean NHL play-by-play (PBP) data from the *NEW* NHL API. The project is maintained by Zach Andrews, known as @StatsByZach on X.

### Dependencies

- pandas
- requests
- numpy
- logging
- BeautifulSoup (bs4)

### Configuration

The program uses a configuration file named `scraper.log` for logging. The log records information about the program's execution, including any errors encountered during API requests.

### Usage

The main functionality of the scraper is to retrieve NHL PBP data for specific dates. The primary functions are:

1. `scrape_date(date)`: Scrapes games from a given date using the NHL API schedule endpoint. Returns a Pandas DataFrame of all plays from every game on the given day.
2. `scrape_game(game_id)`: Scrapes PBP data for a specific game using the NHL API gamecenter endpoint. Returns a Pandas DataFrame of all plays from the given game.

### How to Run

1. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. In another file in the same directory, add `import nhl_pbp_data_scraper as nhlpbpds` in requirments section.
3. Call either the `nhlpbpds.scrape_game(game_id)` or the `nhlpbpds.scrape_date(date)` function.

### Examples

```python
# Example usage to scrape data for a single game
game_id = 2023020300
single_game_pbp = nhlpbpds.scrape_game(2023020300)
print(single_game_pbp.head())

# Example usage to scrape data for a specific date
date = "2023-12-20"
date_pbp = nhlpbpds.scrape_date(date)
print(date_pbp.head())
```

20. **x_coordinate**: X-coordinate of the event on the rink.
21. **y_coordinate**: Y-coordinate of the event on the rink.
22. **zone**: Zone on the rink where the event occurred.
23. **is_shot_on_empty_net_rel**: Indicator if the shot was taken on an empty net relative to the shooting team.

28. **event_p2_name**: Name of the secondary event player.
29. **event_p3_name**: Name of the tertiary event player.
30. **situation_code**: Code representing the game situation. 4 digit code. formatted as number of away goalies on ice, number of away skaters on ice, number of home skaters on ice, number of home goalies on ice. So 1551 would be 5v5 with both goalies in net.
